        About me
    </h2>
    <p1>
        Hello my name is Mohamed El Dogdog and here is a little more about me,<br>
    
        I am a proffessional Football player who started his career in Lisbon, Portugal.<br>

        after only a couple games I was scouted by the best manger in the world at the time Sir Alex Feurgson.<br>

        He then saw my potential and asked me to go to machester united. At the time they were the "Kings of England" <br>
        and to this day I belive they are. Then came the goals and assists, they came heavey, raining on me.
        <br>
        Every single touch of mine was magical and special.
        I was good, too good at some point. then the time for a move came. <br>
        I was contacted by Real Madrid, they wanted me to come, I could even go as far as saying they needed me to come in.
        <br>So I did it was one of the best decision I've ever had.
        At Real Madrid I want everything I want more than I could even imagine more than I have had planned. <br>
        From champions leagues, League titles, nation cups, individual trophies all were things I won at this club.
        <br>Out of all the clubs I want to Real Madrid will forever be my favourite and will forever Have a special place in my heart.
        <br>At the moment I went back to Manchester United although we are not as good as we used to me but I will stay with this team until I make them great again.
